# Thieves-labyrinth

### Description
Thieves Labyrinth is a roguelike game in which the player takes control of a powerful dungeon boss and must defeat the attacking invaders.

### Development
I was a part of the development team, where we were tasked with developing a game from start to finish within four months. Two months were dedicated to developing the engine and two months were dedicated to developing the game. 

#### Personal involvement
I was a part of many aspects of the finished product such as...
- Level/Map Design
- Gameplay Loop/Logic
- Procedural Level Creation
- Event/Debugging Managers
- Particle Effects
- Combat Gameplay
- Game Design Documentation
- 3D modeling and Asset Creation

### Engine Design
The engine is simple. With a basic rendering pipeline using Direct X 10, with a custome made math library for basic physics, and animation. 

We used Direct x 2D for all UI elements.

We decided to go with a Unity style architecture with entities and components. 

We developed a top level game manager class which handled the gameplay logic, created and deleted scenes and provided an easy to use API for creating entities and assigning components to them such as...
- Transforms
- Render
- Collision Volumes
- Lights
- Animators
- Particle Systems
- Custom AI Scripts
